#
# Concrete class: In Python, a concrete class is a class that provides implementations for all of its methods and can be
# instantiated to create objects. Unlike abstract classes, which serve as templates and usually have some methods
# defined without implementations, concrete classes are complete and can be used directly.
# Concreate class vs Abstract Class vs Inteface:
# 1) If we dont know anything about implementation just we have requirement specification then we should go for interface.
# 2) If we are talking about implementation but not completely then we should go for abstract class. (partially implemented class).
# 3) If we are talking about implementation completely and ready to provide service then we should go for concrete class.

# Public, protected , private attributes:
#
# Public attribute:  By default in python every attribute is a public. We can access anywhere with in the class outside side class also
# such kind of attribute is called a public attribute.
#
# name = "ajay"
# class Test:
#     print("name is:", name)
#
# Protected attributes: Protected attributes can be accessed within the class anywhere but from outside of the
# class only in child classes. We can specify an attribute as protected by prefexing with _ symbol
#
#
# class Test1:
#     _fullname = "Ajay kumar"
#     print("full name :", _fullname)
#     def m1(self):
#         print("fullname:", Test1._fullname)
# class Test2(Test1):
#     print("fullname:",Test2._fullname)
#
#
# Private:  private attributes can be accessed only within the class.i.e from outside of the class we
# cannot access. We can declare a variable as private explicitly by prefexing with 2 underscore symbols.

# class Test:
#     a = 40  # Public variable or attribute
#     _b = 50  # protected variable or attribute
#     __c = 60  # private variable or attribute
#
